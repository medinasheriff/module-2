    <h2 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <P><img src="pictures/me.jpg" alt="a picture of me" height="260"/>If you are here, you already know that this blog is about someone that is affiliated with technology. Well, thats true but there is a whole lot you<br/>
       you do not know about this person. let me introduce myself. My name is Medina Folashade Sheriff, <em>formerly</em> Madina Folashade Adeniran, but, most<br/>
       people just call me MD(Emdee). From my change of last name, you might have already guessed that I'm married. Yes, you're right! Anyway, enough on that<br/>
       for now. If you stick around (please, do), you will get to know so much more about me and probably even get inspired by my journey. welcome to my <strong>BLOG!</strong><hr/>


    <h2 id="begin">HOW IT STARTED</h2>

    <P><em><strong>Curiosity</strong></em>, yes, the one they say <em>kills the cat</em>. This is 2022 and you will agree with me that there has been quite the rave about the Tech world since<br/>
       a few years now. This was the main trigger, and for an inquisitive mind like mine, I couldn't let it slide without finding out what its about. so, I searched<br/>
       the internet and what I found left me with many questions as to how it works. I wanted to know, I <em>needed</em> to know how the "tech" world operates, what goes on behind the scenes<br/>
       and so much more.</P>

   <p>well, you know how they always talk about your thoughts, universe, and alignments? Thats sort of what happened to me. no exxagerations here, <em>the universe,</em> didn't literally <em>speak</em><br/>
      to me, but my brother did. he calls me up, and asked what I thought about tech, I told him I've been interested in it recently and would love to <em>transition</em>. Fortunately, he had read about<br/>
      an opportunity on twitter (Alt School Africa), that I could register with, write exams and if I passed, I'd get trained in 1 of 3 tracks: <strong>Frontend, Backend or Cloud Engineering.</strong><br/>
      I was hearing those terms for the first time and I was determined to know more, so I searched for them, registered, got study materials and hoped to pass the entrance exams. <em>Bulky</em> is<br/>
      an understatement for the quantity of materials to study, but I was determined. </p>

   <p>While I was studying and awaiting examination day, my brother called again, he had learnt about another opportunity, <strong>a <spam>FREE</spam> training</strong> program into Web Developing by <spam>eHealth Africa</spam>!<br/>
      This was a dream! An opportunity of a lifetime, so I applied, got through the first phase, wrote the assessment test and I <strong>passed!</strong> and so the journey began.</p><hr/>

      <h2 id="firstclass">INTRODUCTION TO WEB DEVELOPMENT: FIRST DAY IN CLASS</h2>

      <p>
          22/01/2022, thats is the date for me first online class, taken by; Jamil Galadanchi, Aboubakar Douno, and AlHassan Atama, names I'll probably never forget because of excited I was.<br/>
          Finally! to learn how the web works,it seemed so surreal. The class, which was an online class, commenced at 10AM WAT and lasted over 3 hours. This was the Introduction to Web Development<br/>
          You know how it is with being a <em>newbie</em>, learnt a lot, some thrilling, some surprising, some enlightening and a few confusing. It was 3 hours worth it. After the online class,<br/>
          we all got added to a communication chanel:SLACK which is an online communication app. You might be wondering who "we" mean, well, its a Female-Only-Cohort, so <em>we</em> are the other<br/>
          about 40 ladies who passed the assessment test and me. Got assigned mentors to help with our modules and generally serve as guides through the journey (which is super cool and thoughtful of them)<br/>
          The first module was easy, the hard part was only figuring out what tools I needed, how to use the said tools and how to link the tools. Eventhough, we had gotten a crash course earlier during the<br/>
          online class, reality was still a lot more difficult and confusing. After much time and fussing, I finally did it, not without help from the likes of Immaculate and Hamza Danjaji (mentors for 2 other goups)<br/>
          of course but I put in so much too. Its been smooth sailing after that... thats not totally true, but you know what I mean; first time is always the thoughest (I think).</p>

          <p> This is how I learnt the basic web developing tools, how to open and commit a folder into a GitHub account and how to start entries into a webpage using the main programming markup language:HTML.
      </p>

        You are probably wondering what happened to my first Alt School Africa apllication. I will tell you all about that in my next post.
