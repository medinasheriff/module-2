    <h2 id="dcity">DUBAI CITY</h2>

    <p>Dubai is a city and emirate in the <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> and its one of the wealthiest of the seven emirates.<br/>
    It was created in <em>1971</em> following independence from <strong>Great Britain</strong>. Dubai is a city of <strong>skyscrapers,</strong><br/>
    ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside <em>tourism</em>. <strong>Islam</strong> is the majority religion, but<br/>
    churches and <em>Hindu</em> temples coexist with Dubai's mosques.</p>

    <p>Dubai's population has grown steadily over the past two centuries, from just a few thousand local inhabitants to well <em>over</em> <strong>two million!</strong><br/>
    Expatriates in the city vastly outnumber native Emiratis due to the huge influx of skilled expatriates due to the city's construction<br/>
    boom in the later 20th century. Although <strong>Arabic</strong> is the official language, English is, in practice, the <em><strong>lingua franca.</strong></em><br/>
    In the early 21st century, Dubai's art and film industries blossomed, with the annual Art Dubai fair showcasing contemporary art and the<br/>
    Dubai International Film Festival promoting both local and international movies. <srong>Not a fan of Art?</srong> Then, it might interest<br/>
    you to know that Dubai is also home to a large number of international sporting events. </p>
